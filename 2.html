      <h2>soju 무엇인가? CSS</h2>
      <p>소주; 燒酒 [so.dʑu]) is a clear and colorless Korean distilled alcoholic beverage.[1][2][3
         It is usually consumed neat (ABV).[4][5]
         Traditionally, most brands of soju are produced in the Andong region, but soju made from other regions or countries also exists.
         While soju is traditionally made from the grains of rice, wheat, or barley, modern producers often replace rice with other starches, such as potato and sweet potato.
         Soju often appear similar to several other East Asian liquors.[6]
